here the data is stored in hierarchical level

levels in an actual tree: 
    - roots
    - branches
    - leaves

in computers:
    - root is the first level
    - leaves are the last level

in a binary tree:
    - each node can have atmost 2 children
        > left child
        > right child
    
properites of a binary tree:
    - max nodes at level n = 2^n
    - max nodes of a tree with n levels = (2^n) - 1
    - min levels for n nodes = log_2_(n+1)
    - a binTree with n leaves has atleast log_2_(n+1)+1 levels

implementation of binTree:
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *right;
    struct Node *left;

    // constructor 
    Node(int val) {
        data = val;
        left = NULL;
        right = NULL;
    }
}

Traversals:
1) Preorder Traversals
2) Inorder Traversals
3) Postorder Travels


PREORDER TRAVERSALS:
    print the root
    then go its left sub-tree
    then on returing to the root go to its right sub-tree

INORDER TRAVERSALS:
    travel the entire left subTree
    then write the value of root
    travel the entire right subTree

POSTORDER TRAVERSALS:
    travel the entire left subTree
    travel the entire right subTree
    then print the root
